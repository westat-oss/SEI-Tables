# ______________________________________________________________________________
# ---- Function: generate_table_INV4 ----
#
# This function uses DuckDB to join the aggregated commits file with the users file.
# The users file is un-nested for organization, country, and sector. We filter for U.S. government users.
# Then, for each distinct branchâ€“institution (i.e. organization) combination, the earliest commit year is used.
#
# Three aggregations are performed:
#   1. Detailed Agency Aggregation: branch counts where the agency is in specified list.
#   2. Federal Total Aggregation: overall branch count for all distinct agencies.
#   3. All Other Federal Aggregation: branch where agency is not in specified list
#
# The overall counts are summed across all years (so no separate year columns), and the results are
# output with two columns: "Institution" and "Number of repositories".
#
# The final table is written to an Excel sheet.

  ## 1) Read and process the users file ----
  users <- tbl(con, sql(paste0("SELECT * FROM read_parquet('", users_file, "')")))
  
  # Unnest the comma-separated fields for organization, country, and sector.
  # IMPORTANT: This assumes that organization_cleaned, country_cleaned, and sector have aligned lists.

    ) %>%
    # Filter for U.S. government users (we do not restrict by org here so that Federal Total is complete)
    filter(country == "United States", sector == "government")
  
  ## 2) Read the aggregated commits file ----
  # This file has columns: author_id, branch, and min_commit_year.
  commits <- tbl(con, sql(paste0("SELECT * FROM read_parquet('", commits_file, "')")))
  
  ## 3) Join commits with users and select branch, min_commit_year, and org ----
  joined_data <- commits %>%
    inner_join(users_expanded, by = c("author_id" = "id")) %>%
    select(branch, min_commit_year, org) %>%
    distinct()
  
  ## 4) Compute branch-org data: for each branch-org combination, use the earliest commit year ----
  branch_org_data <- joined_data %>%
    distinct(branch, org, min_commit_year) %>% 
    group_by(branch, org) %>%
    summarise(first_commit_year = min(min_commit_year), .groups = "drop")
  
  ## 5) Agency Aggregation: overall distinct branch count per agency (only for agencies of interest) ----

    filter(org %in% agency_list) %>%
    group_by(org) %>%
    summarise(new_branches = n_distinct(branch), .groups = "drop")

  federal_counts_overall <- branch_org_data %>%
    summarise(new_branches = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
    mutate(org = "Federal Total")

 ## 7) All Other Federal Aggregation: overall distinct branch count from all distinct orgs not in specified agency list ----
  other_federal_counts <- branch_org_data %>%
    filter(!(org %in% agency_list)) %>%
    summarise(new_branches = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
    mutate(org = "All Other Federal")
    
  ## 8) Combine the agency and federal totals into one table ----
  
  # Collect the aggregated results into data frames before binding
  agency_df <- agency_counts_overall %>% collect()
  federal_df <- federal_counts_overall %>% collect()
  other_federal_counts_df <- other_federal_counts %>% collect()
    
  final_table <- bind_rows(agency_df, federal_df, other_federal_counts_df)
  
  ## 9) Rename columns and order rows ----
  final_table <- final_table %>%
    rename(Institution = org, `Number of repositories` = new_branches)
  
  # Define desired row order: "Federal Total" first, then the agencies in the specified order.
  desired_order <- c(
    "Federal Total",
    "Agency for International Development",

  )
    
  final_table <- final_table %>%
    mutate(Institution = factor(Institution, levels = desired_order)) %>%
    arrange(Institution)
  
  ## 10) Write the final table to the Excel workbook ----
  if (!is.null(output_file)) {
    if (file.exists(output_file)) {
      wb <- loadWorkbook(output_file)
    } else {
      wb <- createWorkbook()
